#Everyday Quotes

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Using an API provided by Tadas Talikis (https://talaikis.com/random_quotes_api/) as my database, I built a React Redux app called Everyday Quotes. The user can click on the "Get Quotes" button to find an inspirational quote of the day. If the user isn't 'feeling' or liking the given quote, they can click the button again to find a quote that suits them.

Since the quotes are text-centric, I was inspired to design a intertitle like those from the silent film era. Thought it would be a fun design touch along with finding a similar font to match.
